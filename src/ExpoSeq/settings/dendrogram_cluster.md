### Sequence Cluster Dendrogram

The dendrogram you provided is a visualization of the similarity between a set of CDR3 heavy chain sequences. The sequences are clustered together based on their Levenshtein distance, which is described in the previous section.

The dendrogram can be used to understand the diversity of the CDR3 sequences in a sample. For example, if the dendrogram shows that most of the sequences are clustered together in a few large clusters, this suggests that there is a relatively low level of diversity in the sample. On the other hand, if the dendrogram shows that the sequences are spread out in many small clusters, this suggests that there is a high level of diversity in the sample.

The dendrogram can also be used to identify groups of similar sequences. For example, if we want to identify a group of sequences that are likely to have similar antigen-binding specificities, we can look for a cluster of sequences that are close to each other on the dendrogram.
